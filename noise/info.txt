In this project format .noise is used to define Perlin noise applied to terrain, expressed in .mod1 file.

There are two types of noise application :
	general - used on whole map
	hill - used on hill only (and scaled, when generating hill)

The pattern for describing one noise configuration goes like this :
[type : general, hill] : [frequency] [range] (offset) (power)

frequency - frequency of Perlin noise
range - scale of result noise
offset - offset used for Perlin noise generation, should be passed like "([x],[y])"
power - power, applied to result noise
